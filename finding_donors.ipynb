    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "### Answer:\n",
    "1. **Gradient Boosting Classifier**: Adds gradient descent-like feedback to the weak classifiers in AdaBoost\n",
    "    * *Real World Application*: Useful when trying to detect anomalies in supervised learning settings. This is most often done when data is unbalanced, which can occur in situations of DNA Sequences, Credit Card Interactions, and Cybersecurity.\n",
    "    * *Strengths of the Model*: Often provides accuracy that is hard to beat, and can be very flexible when combined with other algorithms. It is also great because it can deal with missing entries and requires little pre-processing of data (can even handle categorical inputs).\n",
    "    * *Weaknesses of the model*: These algorithms try very hard to reduce error, which can lead to overfitting when outliers are found in the data. Because of the complexity of the many techniques being synthesized in Gradient Boosting and the amount of decisions that need to be made for an accurate algorithm, this algorithm is computationally intensive and can take time to complete.\n",
    "    * *What makes the model a good candidate*: In Gradient Boosting, decision trees are used as the weak classifiers to classify the data. This model therefore combines the good aspects of the AdaBoost Classifier, Gradient Descent, and the standard DecisionTrees Classifier. This combination should produce optimized and accurate predictions given the complexity of the inputs in this problem.\n",
    "    * *Sources*: [Gentle Intro to Gradient Boosting](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-gradient-boosting-algorithm-machine-learning/), [University of Cincinnati Gradient Boosting](http://uc-r.github.io/gbm_regression#:~:text=Advantages%3A,and%20numerical%20values%20as%20is.), [GBM vs. Random Forest](https://medium.com/@aravanshad/gradient-boosting-versus-random-forest-cfa3fa8f0d80)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Random Forest Classifier**: A classifier that trains many different decision trees independently by using separate random samples of the data.\n",
    "    * *Real World Application*: Most useful in cases of multi-class object detection. This often occurs in computer vision problems, or in medical diagnosis through bioinformatics.\n",
    "    * *Strengths of the Model*: This algorithm can handle large amounts of data efficiently, and can effectively work through pre-processed data with missing values and categorical inputs. This algorithm offers high predictive accuracy and can weight different integrated data sources if necessary. It is harder to overfit than GBM and is also easier to tune thanks to fewer parameters.\n",
    "    * *Weaknesses of the model*: When datasets require large amounts of trees for accurate prediction, this can lead to increasingly unnacceptable computational difficulty for some applications. When using categorical data, variable importance scores created by Random Forests are not reliable because the classifier is biased towards variables with more categorical levels.\n",
    "    * *What makes the model a good candidate*: This classifier is a good candidate for this problem because it is capable of producing highly-accurate predictions when given a large amount of inputs. It's difficulty to overfit provides a good contrast with GBM and will provide a useful alternative should GBM prove to be ineffective when predicting using the testing data.\n",
    "    * *Sources*: [GB vs. Random Forest](https://medium.com/@aravanshad/gradient-boosting-versus-random-forest-cfa3fa8f0d80)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **AdaBoost Classifier**: Aims to convert a set of weak classifiers into a strong one.\n",
    "    * *Real World Application*: Classifying types of topics customers are calling or talking about.\n",
    "    * *Strengths of the Model*: AdaBoost Classification can be used for both regression and classification problems. Boosting algorithms are often more capable of accurate prediction when data has non-linear trends. A fast model with little prior knowledge needed and that is flexible enough to be combined with other algorithms. Easy to program in Python and R.\n",
    "    * *Weaknesses of the model*: AdaBoost fails when weak classifiers are too complex, as this leads to overfitting. Similarly, if weak classifiers are *too* weak, the algorithm can underfit or overfit given the circumstances.\n",
    "    * *What makes the model a good candidate*: This model selects weaker vertical and horizontal (naive) classifiers and then determines which were most helpful for each section of the data. I believe that this would be useful in this problem because of the large amount of inputs in this dataset, and AdaBoost has the ability to determine the effectiveness of each input with finnesse. The AdaBoost classifier has the advantage of speed over the above options. If AdaBoost fails to effectively predict, then it is likely the problem has too many inputs for AdaBoost to handle effectively.\n",

    "### Answer:\n",
    "When applying each of the three classifiers above to the prediction of income among provided individuals, the Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost algorithms performed similarly well in both training and testing environments. The Random Forest classifier, on the other hand, excelled in the training set, but failed to perform well in the testing set when compared to the two Boosted algorithms. The split in performance between the training and testing datasets for the Random Forest algorithm indicates overtraining. This is an unexpected result, since most resources indicated that the Random Forest classifier was less prone to overfitting than either of the Boosted Algorithms, but especially the Gradient Boosting Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that the complexity of the inputs in the dataset proved to be too much for the Random Forest algorithm to effectively train without overfitting. It seems that the Boosted Algorithms were effective in dealing with this complexity, and therefore would both be candidates as the optimum algorithm for this problem. Both Boosting Algorithms successfully met the threshold of accuracy and f-score for the training set, but need to improve their f-score in the test set. This said, each offers it's own advantages. The Gradient Boosting Classifier took more than 6 times as long to train than the AdaBoost algorithm. That said, the AdaBoost algorithm took over twice as long to predict using the test set than the Gradient Boosting Classifier. This means that the Gradient Boosting algorithm would be ideal for datasets with few known data points to train the classifier, but many data points that need classification. Conversely, the AdaBoost algorithm is ideal for datasets with larger training sets but relatively smaller predictive sets due to the increased amount of time it requires to predict. In our case, I would pick the AdaBoost algorithm due to the smaller size of our dataset. \n"

    "The chosen classification algorithm for this scenario, AdaBoost, essentially works by combining many variations of an inaccurate prediction into an effective and accurate decision maker. The innacurate prediction mechanisms are called *weak classifiers*. These classifiers have just over 50% accuracy in making binary predictions for our problem. In our case, the AdaBoost algorithm may have started with a weak classifier that correctly predicted whether a person earned more than 50K a year 55% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the predictive accuracy, the AdaBoost algorithm takes several of these weak classifiers and weights them. To do so, it punishes the weak classifiers that make many mistakes, and prevents them from having as much of a say in the ultimate, accurate classifier that is created by the algorithm. In other words, depending on how accurate these classifiers are in separate sections of the data, different classifiers are given preference for that section of data. As different weak classifiers are pieced together across the breadth of the data, a strong classifier is formed.\n",

    "* The naive predictor benchmark featured an accuracy score of 0.7522 and an F-score of 0.7914. The accuracy score of the AdaBoost model therefore predicts a full 10% more accurately than the naive predictor, while the F-score of the AdaBoost model is actually over 5% worse than the naive predictor. This is not an expected result. Ideally, the accuracy score would have surpassed 90%, and the F-Score should have improved."

    "## Feature Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "An important task when performing supervised learning on a dataset like the census data we study here is determining which features provide the most predictive power. By focusing on the relationship between only a few crucial features and the target label we simplify our understanding of the phenomenon, which is most always a useful thing to do. In the case of this project, that means we wish to identify a small number of features that most strongly predict whether an individual makes at most or more than \\$50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a scikit-learn classifier (e.g., adaboost, random forests) that has a `feature_importance_` attribute, which is a function that ranks the importance of features according to the chosen classifier.  In the next python cell fit this classifier to training set and use this attribute to determine the top 5 most important features for the census dataset."

    "### Answer:\n",
    "*This is all my opinion*\n",
    "1. **education_level**: The single most important indicator for whether someone makes over 50K a year should be education. Most people who make over 50K will have at least a bachelor's degree because it is this education that forms the minimum requirement for many of the highest paying jobs. While there are some outliers, such as tech entrepreneurs that dropped out of college to start successful business, these instances are rare, and do not skew the population enough to make education an unimportant factor.\n",
    "2. **hours-per-week**: Hours per week is another extremely important indicator for the financial compensation an individual recieves for their work. Half time workers, understandably, make half as much as full time workers. This portion of the data could be skewed by individuals who work more than 40 hours a week, since these individuals may not recieve compensation for the time they work if they are salaried employees or business owners themselves. Again, I don't believe these individuals skew the data enough to reduce the importance of the hours-per-week metric.\n",
    "3. **age**: Age is an important factor for the compensation that employees recieve since the older they are, the more likely it is that they will have more relevant work experience than their peers. Generally, this work experience results in greater compensation, thus, age should be a relevant metric for the prediction of income.\n",
    "4. **occupation**: Occupation is an important factor because in many cases, people who are very qualified and may have lots of experience in their field may not be able to land jobs that make the full use of their abilities. This is the classic example of an individual with a degree or certificate that is forced to work at a place like Starbucks due to the competitive job market. For this reason, occupation is likely an important decider in an individual's income.\n",
    "5. **workclass**: This metric affects an individual's income in that private sector workers tend to make the most money. Public and government workers, conversely, tend to make less money when placed in the same role due to budget constraints (even if their jobs are more secure). The last option, being self employed, can either indicate high, middle, or low income depending on the success of the business or venture the individual is taking part of. Regardless, this should be an important factor in determining the income of an individual. While less important than the factors listed above, it should be more important than individual factors such as race, gender, or country of origin."

    "* The five features that I discussed in Question 6 were Education, Hours-per-Week, Age, Occupation, and Work Class. The five features that were deemed most important by the algorithm did not include Occupation and Work Class, but Capital Gain and Capital Loss instead. In other words, I successfully predicted three of the most important factors, even if I did not predict them in the correct order.\n",
    "* I believe that Occupation and Work Class were not deemed as important by the classifier because of their inconsistency across points in the data. The dataset had likely a large amount of variation within the income ranges of each type of occupation and work class and this made it difficult for the algorithm to come to any meaningful conclusions based on these factors. Conversely, I have no idea why capital gain and capital loss were so important for accurate prediction in the algorithm. Perhaps if someone has an asset that is depreciating or appreciating severly in value, they are more likely to sell it? If the money made off the sale of the asset is included in the income of the individual, then it would make sense that individuals that sold their assets would have made the most money."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "* Curiously, the reduced data led to both reduced accuracy and a reduce F-score. While the reduction in the accuracy is acceptable and still lies above the accuracy of the naive predictor, the F-score was reduced greatly - far below an ideal value.\n",
    "* I find it unlikely that I would use a reduced data set as my training set for this particular application. The full dataset does not require that much computational time and energy relative to the reduced dataset, and the reduction in the model's predictive capability when using the reduced dataset is not worth this marginal time difference. That said, if the data set contained hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points, then it might be worth reducing the size of the training data, espetially when figuring out which classifiers are best or when tuning models. This is because the larger the set, the larger the time gained by reducing its dimentionality."
